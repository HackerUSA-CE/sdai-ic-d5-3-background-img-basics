# Cascade Cafe Parallax Effect

This project demonstrates a parallax effect for the Cascade Cafe website. The parallax effect is achieved using HTML and CSS, with a focus on creating an engaging user experience.

## Objectives

- Understand how to use CSS to create a parallax effect.
- Apply background image properties to create visually appealing backgrounds.
- Learn how to use HTML and CSS to structure and style a simple webpage.

## Instructions

### 1. Introduction

The parallax effect creates an illusion of depth by having the background image move at a different speed than the foreground content as you scroll.

### 2. Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### Task 1: Apply a Background Image

- Add the `background-image` property to the `.parallax` class at the bottom of the CSS file.
- Set the image URL to `assets/images/cafe-club.jpg`.

#### Task 2: Control the Image Size

- Apply the `background-size` property to the `.parallax` class and set it to `cover`.

#### Task 3: Prevent the Image from Repeating

- Use the `background-repeat` property and set it to `no-repeat`.

#### Task 4: Center the Image

- Set the `background-position` property to `center`.

#### Task 5: Add a Parallax Effect

- Use the `background-attachment` property and set it to `fixed`.

### 3. Review

- Review the applied background image properties to ensure they work as expected.
