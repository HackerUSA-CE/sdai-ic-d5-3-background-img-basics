# Parallax Effect Implementation

### Prepare Your Workspace
1. [ ] First, stop any other Codespaces you have running to conserve core hours.

## Forking Repositories
When you fork a repo, there is a box checked by default to only copy the main branch. You will want to uncheck this box so that you get all the branches you need. 

If you forget to uncheck that box, you can still get access to the other branches you need. You'll need to follow the instructions from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch), taking special note of step 5 when you reach it.

## Branch Management
These activities use several branches. After watching your instructor's initial demo, you'll need to use two branches in order. 

First, you'll need to use the `together` branch to try an activity alongside your instructor. This may be very similar to the demo you saw, but you'll get to practice these skills, too.
Next, you'll use the `solo` branch to push yourself and learn more. Getting hands on like this teaches you a lot, but you can still ask your AI and your instructor for help.

You can switch branches by using this command:

`git checkout branch-name`

Examples:

```
git checkout together
```

```
git checkout solo
```


## ToDo list âœ…
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. [ ] **Create a New HTML File**
   - Create a new `index.html` file and add the basic boilperplate and structure. **Recall:** use `!` the hit `enter` to quickly and easily add boilerplate to your HTML file, which should now look something like this:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>Parallax Effect</title>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     </head>
     <body>

     </body>
     </html>
     ```

2. [ ] **Add a `<section>` Element w/ PLaceholder Text**
   - Add a `<section>` element with a class of `parallax-section`:
     ```html
     <section class="parallax-section"></section>
     ```
   - Inside this section, add multiple paragraphs of lorem ipsum text to take up more than 2/3 or a screen's worth of space both above and below the image. Use your AI for help as needed, as it can rapidly produce a great deal of lorem ipsum already in paragraph tags.
   - **EXample Prompt**: Produce 12 paragraphs of lorem ipsum in HTML paragraph tags. Each paragraph should have at least three long sentences. 

3. [ ] **Find and Add an Image**
   - **Find an Image**: Use [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) or [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com) to find a suitable image. Ensure the image is of high quality and free to use.
   - **Download the Image**: Click the download button on the chosen image to save it to your computer.
   - **Create Directory**: In your VS Code workspace, create a directory named `assets`, and within it, create another directory named `images`.
   - **Add to VS Code**: Move the downloaded image to the newly created `assets/images` folder within your VS Code workspace.

4. [ ] **Set as Background Image**: Update the `background-image` property in your CSS file to target the new image:
     ```css
     .parallax-section {
         background-image: url('assets/images/your-image-file.jpg');
         background-size: cover;
         background-repeat: no-repeat;
         background-position: center;
         background-attachment: fixed;
         max-height: 50vh; /* Set maximum height to 50vh */
     }
     ```

5. [ ] **Provide Attribution**: Add attribution for the image in this README file:
     ```markdown
     ## Image Attribution
     - Image used in the parallax section by [Photographer Name](URL-to-photographer-profile) from Pexels/Unsplash
     ```


### Explanation of CSS Properties
- **background-image**: Sets the background image for the section.
- **background-size: cover**: Ensures the image covers the entire section.
- **background-repeat: no-repeat**: Prevents the image from repeating.
- **background-position: center**: Centers the image within the section.
- **background-attachment: fixed**: Creates the parallax effect by fixing the background image in place while the rest of the content scrolls.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure the file path in the `url('assets/images/your-image-file.jpg')` is correct relative to your CSS file location.
- The `max-height: 50vh` property ensures the section's height does not exceed half of the viewport height (the veiwable area as adjusted for the device).
- Always provide proper attribution for images according to the guidelines of Pexels or Unsplash.
- Test your design across different screen sizes to ensure the parallax effect works well.
