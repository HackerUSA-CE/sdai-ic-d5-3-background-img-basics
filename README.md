# Cascade Cafe Parallax Effect

This project demonstrates a parallax effect for the Cascade Cafe website. The parallax effect is achieved using HTML and CSS, with a focus on creating an engaging user experience.

## Objectives

- Understand how to use CSS to create a parallax effect.
- Apply background image properties to create visually appealing backgrounds.
- Learn how to use HTML and CSS to structure and style a simple webpage.

### Prepare Your Workspace
1. [ ] First, stop any other Codespaces you have running to conserve core hours.

## Forking Repositories
When you fork a repo, there is a box checked by default to only copy the main branch. You will want to uncheck this box so that you get all the branches you need. 

If you forget to uncheck that box, you can still get access to the other branches you need. You'll need to follow the instructions from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch), taking special note of step 5 when you reach it.

## Branch Management
These activities use several branches. After watching your instructor's initial demo, you'll need to use two branches in order. 

First, you'll need to use the `together` branch to try an activity alongside your instructor. This may be very similar to the demo you saw, but you'll get to practice these skills, too.
Next, you'll use the `solo` branch to push yourself and learn more. Getting hands on like this teaches you a lot, but you can still ask your AI and your instructor for help.

You can switch branches by using this command:

`git checkout branch-name`

Examples:

```
git checkout together
```

```
git checkout solo
```

### 1. Introduction

The parallax effect creates an illusion of depth by having the background image move at a different speed than the foreground content as you scroll.

### 2. Step-by-Step Walkthrough

- [ ] Task 1: Apply a Background Image
    - Add the `background-image` property to the `.parallax` class at the bottom of your CSS file.
    - Set the image URL to `assets/images/cafe-club.jpg`.
    - Your background has to have a size for it to show up, so let's add a `height` of `50vh`.

- [ ] Task 2: Control the Image Size
    - Apply the `background-size` property to the `.parallax` class and set it to `cover`.

- [ ] Task 3: Prevent the Image from Repeating
    - Use the `background-repeat` property and set it to `no-repeat`.

- [ ] Task 4: Center the Image
    - Set the `background-position` property to `center`.

- [ ] Task 5: Add a Parallax Effect
    - Use the `background-attachment` property and set it to `fixed`.

- [ ] Task 6: Make quick design improvements
    - Here are a few options to consider:
    - Try setting `border-radius` to `3%` to create round edges on the image, then adjust to your preference
    - Consider setting `margin` to `2rem 0` and experiment with other values until things look spaced nicely

### 3. Review

- Review the applied background image properties to ensure they work as expected.

### 4. No solo exercise
You've already mastered the basics of parallax imagery upon completing this, so we'll learn and apply more of our skills instead!

### Congratulations ðŸŽ‰

You have successfully learned the basics of manipulating background images using CSS! You've learned how to:

- Apply a background image.
- Control the size of the background image.
- Prevent the background image from repeating.
- Center the background image.
- Add a parallax effect.

Keep experimenting with different properties to create visually appealing backgrounds!
